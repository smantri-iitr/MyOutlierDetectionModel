# MyOutlierDetectionModel

Idea is to find n-nearest neighbors -> then calculate mean distance of these neighbors from the point 
-> sort the mean descending in descending order -> find the top N outliers!!

LOGIC : higher the mean distance -> chances are higher for being an outlier

choose k wisely-> think of k as min number u would consider for a group
