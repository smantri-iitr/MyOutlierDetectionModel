# MyOutlierDetectionModel

*** X is 2D array and not a Dataframe ***

Idea is to find n-nearest neighbors -> then calculate mean distance of these neighbors from the point 
-> sort the mean descending in descending order -> find the top N outliers!!

LOGIC : higher the mean distance -> chances are higher for being an outlier
